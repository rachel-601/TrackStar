## TrackStar

This application is an easy way for users to track their weekly fitness progress by calculating the total calories they 
have burned from all their runs. It can also give a report on one's statistics after at least one run has been 
recorded. TrackStar can be used by **anyone** who is interested in working out and recording their progress 
over time. 

I am interested in making this application because I enjoy exercising in my free time, and I find that seeing my 
progress over time increases my motivation to continue working out. Going on runs has always been a great way for me to
de-stress and stay fit, so having an application that can keep track of all the runs I go on is *extremely* useful.

The TrackStar can display the:
- date of a run
- distance of a run
- duration of a run
- total calories burned from all runs
- average speed of all runs
- fastest run
- longest run
